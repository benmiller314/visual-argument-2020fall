# Draft 1 Summary

As a whole, the first draft of the visual argument project is left in its barebones state. Only the bare skeletal structure of the project has been put into place. Right now, there are only three significant pieces to the project, the two phones, and the white box.

In the future, multiple more things are going to be added to the project. Text still needs to be added to the textbox, that correlates to the idea that is trying to be conveyed. Likewise, more assets still have to be received and put into the project file.

The idea for the future of the project is to detail two halves of a story. The first part will detail a character getting invested in the internet, primarily a small online community. This will be conveyed by showing the character walking "through" the screen of the phone. The second half will detail the character leaving the internet and going back to the real world, which is of course shown by the character crossing back through the phone.

The idea of this two part story is to show the dichotomy between the user influencing the internet and the user being influenced by the internet. Colors will be used to show a shift in mood and personality, depicting the character in one color for the first part to show wonder and naivety, and another color signify hatred and anger.

Of course, everything has the possibility to change, but the overall message will remain constant in the project.
