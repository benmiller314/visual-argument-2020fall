### By Nick Pekor

Thought Collective is a piece based on the present society the world is in currently. In a time where everyone is connected to everyone else through the internet, a major change has been seen in the ways opinions are formulated. Nowadays, it seems as if everyone tries to see what everyone else has to say about a piece of media before thinking about it themselves. Likewise, the internet influences people in many other ways. Some individuals seem to change their ways of life by what the internet tells them to do. This piece argues that the way people think has been changed by the introduction of social media and the internet in general.
