I want this preview to look like a travel information poster. At first, I wanted to mimic vintage travel posters. I had an image in my mind which had only a few words. It would show off a single destination and then let the chosen images explain to the audience what the argument was.  I think that my message/argument will focus on a region instead of a single location. I want to interest people in the entire space rather than just one island. To do this, I may have to add several lines of text. I think that this project may evolve into an infographic. I will have to tinker around and find creative ways to present the information. I thought about sectioning off compartments to explain the different groups of pacific islands. I will have to approach the project from a different angle because I think that my current idea will be crowded and dense. 


Gimp has been fairly intuitive to learn. Despite my user interface being extremely zoomed out, I could still find my way around the program. I think the locking feature is useful. When compared to other image editing softwares I have used, the feature makes for a much tidier workspace and project. Images and assets have been easy to source too. I have found that unsplash.com is a very useful tool for this project. A good background for a poster is a must and I think that I have found a perfect high definition background. Additionally, search.creativecommons.org is a very useful image aggregator. I have found several fair use images which will work well in my project. For my next steps, I will come up with an effective way to present the bulk of my argument. I think that I will definitely retain my title and subtitle.
